            <p>I bomb atomically, Socrates philosophies and hypotheses can't define how I be droppin' these
Mockeries, lyrically performed armed robbery,
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle scarred shotgun, explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous, ultraviolet shine blinds forensics
I inspect you through the future, see millenium
Killer bees sold 50 gold, 60 platinum
Shacklin' the masses with drastic rap tactics,
Graphic displays, meltin' steel like blacksmiths.</p>

"A human being is part of the whole called by us 'universe', a part limited in time and space. We experience ourselves, our thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest. A kind of optical delusion of consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from the prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. The true value of a human being is determined by the measure and the sense in which they have obtained liberation from the self. We shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if humanity is to survive. " (Albert Einstein, 1954)
